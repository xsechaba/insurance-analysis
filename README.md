# Insurance Analytics Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive data analytics pipeline for the insurance industry, focusing on deriving actionable insights from insurance data through advanced analysis and visualization. The project includes data processing, analysis, and interactive dashboard development.

## Problem Statement
The insurance industry faces several key challenges:
1. **Data Quality Issues**: Incomplete or unorganized datasets
2. **Fraudulent Claims**: Need for efficient fraud detection
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Limited understanding of customer demographics
4. **Profitability Assessment**: Difficulty in evaluating profit margins across segments

## Solution Components
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Python-based data cleaning and analysis
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Power BI visualization of key metrics
- **Analysis Modules**: Customer segmentation, fraud detection, and profitability analysis
